# --------------HTTPX-Advanced-Tool-for-Penetration-Tester--------------

Today we will take a look at one of the project discovery tools for httpx penetration tester.

httpx is a fast and multifunctional HTTP toolkit that allows you to run multiple tests using the retryablehttp library. It was developed to achieve reliable results even with higher thread counts.
Httpx is a new generation tool for collecting information about our target, developed on Golang httpx, making the testing phase easier and more complex.

What advantage of httpx tool?
1- Supports Host, URL, and CIDR as input.
2- Handles edge cases while retrying, back, etc. to handle WAF.
3- vHost supports URL, port, title, content length, status code, and response-body checking.

Why HTTPX?
Httpx helps collect information to detect vulnerabilities and control attack vectors in web applications. This is basically based on domain enumeration which helps to find the status code of a particular subdomain, print the content type and print the page title if available.

Thanks....
